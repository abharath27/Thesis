\section{Additive model for updating weights of attributes}
\label{sec:additive}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:maut}, the weight of a numeric attribute is either multiplied or divided by a constant factor $\beta (=2.0)$ depending on whether the new preference value is better than the old preference value or not.
Instead of the standard multiplicative model, we propose a new additive model for updating the weights of attributes.
In a given interaction cycle, if the new preference value for a product is better than the old preference value, the weight of the attribute is increased by a factor $\beta$.
Else, the weight of the attribute is not changed.
The weights of numeric attributes are normalized after they are updated so that they sum up to one. 
In our implementation, we have set $\beta$ = 0.5 and it gave the best results.
Algorithm \ref{algo:add} will be referred to as \textbf{ADD} in subsequent sections.
The function UpdateModel($PM$, $ref$) is updated as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
  \SetKwInOut{Input}{input}\SetKwInOut{Output}{output}
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  %\Input{$PM$, $IS$}

  \For{each attribute $x_i$ in ref }{
      $[pv_i, pw_i] \leftarrow PM on x_i$;\\
      \If {$V(x_i) \geq pv_i$} {
          $pw_i' = pw_i + \beta $;\\
      }
      $PM' \leftarrow [V(x_i), norm(pw_i')]$;\\
  }
  \Return $PM$;\\
