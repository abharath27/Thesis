\section{Similar Products in the First Cycle}
As seen in Section \ref{sec:maut}, weights of numeric attributes and the value functions of nominal attributes are initialized to default values at the beginning of every recommendation session.
Therefore, the top $K$ utility products presented to the user in the first cycle is the same irrespective of initial preferences given by the user.
Instead of presenting the top $K$ utility products in the first cycle, we present products that are most similar to the user's query.
When the user selects one of those similar products, the preference model is updated in the proper direction such that the target product shows up quickly in top $K$ products.
