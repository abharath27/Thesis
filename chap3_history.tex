\section{Considering history of user selected products}
In Figure \ref{fig:maut}, $ref$ is the product selected by the user in previous interaction cycle.
Preference model is updated only considering the most recently selected product's attribute values.
Instead, we now maintain a list of products selected by the user in previous interaction cycles and update the model according to the weighted average of these products' attributes.
The function UpdateModel($PM$, $ref$) is updated as follows:


%Before that put an equation with a sigma in that...
%Give an example here...
%That would be like putting the last nail of the coffin to settle things down

      \For{each product p $\in$ refL }{
          $ref[x_i] +=  hw_i \times p[x_i] $;\\
          $ws += hw_i$;\\
      }
      $ref[x_i] = ref[x_i]/ws$; \\

          $pw_i' = pw_i \times \beta $;\\
      }
      \Else {
          $pw_i' = pw_i / \beta $;\\
      }
      $PM' \leftarrow [V(x_i), pw_i']$;\\
